# survey-form

This is my second FreeCodeCamp project. 

As simple as this project seems, it taught me a whole lot and helped me rectify holes in my knowlege with respect to how modern CSS layout tools such as flexbox play with forms.

I explored several markup options and CSS rules before settling for what I used on this project. Going forward, I will attempt to refine my implementation further in other projects.

I also had fun with Sass in this project.
